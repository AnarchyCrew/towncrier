Add support for subcommands, meaning the functionality of the ``towncrier``
executable is now replaced by the ``build`` subcommand::

    $ towncrier build --draft

A new ``check`` subcommand is exposed. This is an alternative to calling the
``towncrier.check`` module manually::

    $ towncrier check

Calling ``towncrier`` without a subcommand will result in a call to the
``build`` subcommand to ensure backwards compatibility. This may be removed in a
future release.
